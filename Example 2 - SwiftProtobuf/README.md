# Example 2 - SwiftProtobuf

This example uses a build tool plugin to generate Swift code from ``.proto`` files during a build of a Swift Package. It currently requires a modified fork of the `swift-protobuf` which adds a SwiftPM plugin script as well (temporarily) a binary of the `protoc` compiler.

This example requires SwiftPM 5.6 or later.
